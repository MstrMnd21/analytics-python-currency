#### 2018.06.12
*    1. The next versions will be about: 
*            a. Maximizing the length of pip wins. 
*                - check exactly the time where the TP level appears. 
*            b. Minimizing risk by adjusting ATR. 
*            C. Maximizing wins by adding more entries.
*            d. Matplotlib visualizations
*            e. Daily and hourly chart must be well reshaped for easy data manipulation

*    2. Robot Advisor
*            a. Using C++ and built in drag and drap app from MT5

*    3. Test notes for git expl
            - testing pull
            - test odf
#### 2018.06.20
*       1. Fix data reshape process
*       2. Codes must be flexible and variable for time
*       3. Only 54% win rate for sell trades and this may not be accurate because there are a lot of NaN fields in the dataset. We need to redo the csv loading.
